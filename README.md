Hereâ€™s the **problem statement** in short, with clear facts and examples:

---

### Problem

You manage a **shared e-bike station** with **40 bikes**. Every **15 minutes** you must set a **price tier** (Low / Medium / High).

* **Demand depends on time of day** (morning/evening commute peaks) and your chosen price.
* **If you price too low** â†’ you may run out of bikes early (angry customers â†’ lost revenue later).
* **If you price too high** â†’ customers donâ€™t rent enough, and bikes sit idle.

### What we are solving with Reinforcement Learning

We want an **AI agent** that automatically learns a **dynamic pricing policy** to maximize daily revenue while balancing:

1. **Utilization** â€“ make sure bikes are used throughout the day.
2. **Customer satisfaction** â€“ donâ€™t stock out early.
3. **Profit** â€“ set prices that adapt to peaks vs. quiet hours.

### Why RL is a good fit

* The decision process is **sequential**: pricing now affects future bike availability.
* The environment is **stochastic**: demand is uncertain and time-dependent.
* We can frame it as a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**:

  * **State:** (time of day, bikes left)
  * **Action:** price tier (Low / Medium / High)
  * **Reward:** revenue âˆ’ penalties (stockouts, leftover bikes)
* RL learns policies that balance **short-term rewards** (todayâ€™s rentals) with **long-term rewards** (having bikes left for rush hour).

### Real-world analogy

* **Uber/Lyft surge pricing:** set higher prices during peak demand to balance supply & demand.
* **Airline yield management:** airlines dynamically adjust ticket prices to avoid selling out too early or flying with empty seats.
* **Parking meters in cities:** prices rise in busy hours and drop in off-peak times to optimize usage.

ðŸ‘‰ In short:
Weâ€™re teaching an RL agent to **act like a smart pricing manager** for a bike station, making **time-aware, demand-aware, inventory-aware** pricing decisions that maximize overall business performance.

Do you want me to also make a **one-slide style summary** of this (problem + RL solution) so you can reuse it in presentations?
